# David's Portfolio and Blog Site

It's crazy that I'm not already doing this, but I'm so sick of WordPress as that's my business, and I wanted to roll my own. I did an earlier site in Gatsby, but for me it wasn't quite right, so here we are.

## NEXT Notes

Next takes over the NPM run scripts (see package.json) Use `npm run [dev/build/start]`

### Pages

Pages live in /pages/page.js (filename must start with lowercase)

```
const Index = () => {
  return (<h1>index of my portfolio</h1>);
};

export default Index;
```
