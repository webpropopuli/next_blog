# David's Portfolio and Blog Site

It's crazy that I'm not already doing this, but I'm so sick of WordPress as that's my business, and I wanted to roll my own. I did an earlier site in Gatsby, but for me it wasn't quite right, so here we are.

Build details are in the NOTES.md

Starting code: https://github.com/Jerga99/portfolio-jerga
